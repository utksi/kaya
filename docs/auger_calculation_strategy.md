# Auger Recombination in Perovskites: Calculation Strategy

## Overview
Strategy for calculating Auger recombination rates in halide perovskites using frequency-dependent screening from VASP.

## Importance of Dynamic Screening

### Limitations of Static Screening
1. **Overestimation of Screening**
   - Static W(ω=0) assumes instantaneous response
   - Real materials can't screen high-frequency processes fully
   - Leads to underestimated Auger rates

2. **Missing Physical Processes**
   - Plasmon-assisted transitions
   - Resonant enhancement near plasma frequency
   - Energy-dependent dielectric response
   - Retardation effects

3. **Energy Scale Considerations**
   ```
   Relevant energies in perovskites:
   - Bandgap: 1.0 - 2.3 eV
   - Plasma frequency: ~2-4 eV
   - Core-level screening: ~5-10 eV
   
   Static screening valid when: ΔE << ωp
   Dynamic effects important when: ΔE ~ ωp
   ```

### Quantitative Impact
1. **Error Magnitude**
   - Semiconductors: 20-50% error in rates
   - Metals: Even larger due to plasmons
   - Error increases with transition energy

2. **System Dependence**
   ```
   Error scaling with material properties:
   Error ∝ (ΔE/ωp)² for ΔE < ωp
   Error ∝ constant for ΔE > ωp
   ```

3. **When Static Approximation Fails Most**
   - High-energy transitions
   - Strong plasmon coupling
   - Metallic screening
   - Resonant processes

### Physical Picture
1. **Screening Dynamics**
   ```
   W(ω) = v/ε(ω)
   
   Static: ε(0) = full screening
   Dynamic: ε(ω) = reduced screening at high ω
   ```

2. **Time Scales**
   - Electronic response: ~1 fs
   - Auger transition: ~0.1-1 fs
   - Screening buildup: ~0.1-1 fs

3. **Frequency Regions**
   ```
   ω << ωp: Static screening valid
   ω ~ ωp: Plasmon effects crucial
   ω > ωp: Weak screening
   ```

## Energy Transfer in Auger Process

1. **Definition of ΔE**
   ```
   For Auger recombination e1 + e2 → e3 + e4:
   ΔE = |E3 - E1| or |E4 - E2|
   
   Example for typical process:
   - e1: electron in conduction band (Ec)
   - e2: electron in conduction band (Ec)
   - e3: hole in valence band (Ev)
   - e4: electron excited high in conduction band (Ec + Eg)
   
   Then: ΔE ≈ Eg (bandgap energy)
   ```

2. **Why ΔE Matters**
   - Represents energy transferred via W(ω)
   - Determines which frequency components of W are important
   - Usually comparable to bandgap in direct Auger
   - Can be modified by plasmons: ΔE ± ℏωp

3. **Frequency Sampling Strategy**
   ```
   Need W(ω) at frequencies around ΔE:
   ω ≈ ΔE ± δω
   
   For perovskites:
   - CsPbI₃: ΔE ≈ 1.7 eV
   - CsSnI₃: ΔE ≈ 1.3 eV
   - Plus/minus ~0.5 eV for integration
   ```

## Physical Processes

### Direct Auger Process
- Energy conservation: E₁ + E₂ = E₃ + E₄
- Matrix element: M = ⟨12|W(ΔE)|34⟩
- Requires frequency-dependent W(G,G',ω)

### Phonon-Assisted Process (Future Work)
- Modified conservation: E₁ + E₂ = E₃ + E₄ ± ℏωph
- Additional matrix element: ⟨i|∂V/∂R|f⟩
- Temperature dependence through phonon occupation

## Computational Strategy

### 1. Frequency-Dependent Screening
```python
# Key frequency points to sample
frequencies = [
    0.0,           # static limit
    Eg/2,          # mid-gap
    Eg,            # direct Auger
    wp,            # plasmon frequency
    Eg + wp,       # plasmon-assisted
    2*Eg           # high-energy limit
]
```

### 2. VASP Calculations
1. Run low-scaling GW (ALGO=G0W0R)
2. Set different NOMEGA_DUMP values
3. Extract W(G,G',ω) from WFULL files
4. Interpolate between frequency points

### 3. Matrix Element Calculation
```python
def calculate_auger_rate(material):
    # Get frequency-dependent W
    W_freq = {}
    for freq in get_frequency_points(material):
        W_freq[freq] = read_wfull_data(f"WFULL{freq:04d}.tmp")
    
    # Calculate matrix elements
    M_auger = 0
    for k1, k2, k3, k4 in transition_states:
        dE = E3 + E4 - (E1 + E2)
        W_dE = interpolate_W(W_freq, dE)
        M_auger += compute_matrix_element(w1, w2, w3, w4, W_dE)
    
    return calculate_rate(M_auger)
```
