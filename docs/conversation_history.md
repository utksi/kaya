   W(G,G',ω) = ε⁻¹(G,G',ω) v(G-G')
   ```

2. **Auger Matrix Element**
   ```
   M_Auger = ∫∫ dr dr' ψ₁*(r)ψ₂*(r')W(r,r',ΔE)ψ₃(r)ψ₄(r')
   ```

## Initial Discussion: WFULL Files and GW Calculations

**User**: So are these values W(G, G', ω -> 0)?
Can I use these for the matrix elements for auger recombination ..etc?
What do I lose if I don't include frequency?

**Assistant**: Analysis of using W for Auger calculations:

1. Static vs Dynamic W:
   - WFULL files contain W(G,G',q,ω) at specific ω points
   - Static limit (ω→0) overestimates screening
   - Dynamic effects important for Auger processes

2. Impact on Matrix Elements:
   - Auger processes involve energy transfer
   - Matrix element: M_Auger ~ <12|W(ω=ΔE)|34>
   - Using static W(ω=0) misses:
     * Dynamic screening effects
     * Plasmon-assisted processes
     * Energy-dependent screening
     * Retardation effects

3. Error Estimates:
   - Semiconductors: 20-50% error
   - Metals: Larger error due to plasmons
   - Error depends on system and process

**User**: Is there some other alternative to getting frequency dependent W apart from running it again and again to get it at different frequency points?

**Assistant**: Explained several alternatives:
1. Plasmon-Pole Models (PPM)
2. Analytical Continuation
3. Model Dielectric Functions
4. Kramers-Kronig Relations
5. RPA with Model Hamiltonian

**User**: This is what's mentioned about low-scaling GW on the vasp-wiki: [Quoted VASP Wiki content about G0W0R]

**Assistant**: Analyzed G0W0R approach:
- Works on imaginary frequency axis (iω)
- More efficient (cubic scaling)
- Uses ~12-20 frequency points
- Can get full frequency dependence
- Better numerical stability

**User**: Can changes in the existing VASP source code be made to do this?

**Assistant**: Discussed possible modifications to VASP source code to output W(G,G',iω).
Explained key files and implementation strategy.

**User**: How would we get it on the real frequency grid then?

**Assistant**: Clarified difference between:
1. Current WFULL (direct real-axis calculation)
2. G0W0R (imaginary axis + analytical continuation)
Explained advantages of G0W0R approach.

**User**: I was mainly going to go with perovskites like CsPbI3 (gap = 1.7 eV), CsSnI3 (gap = 1.3 eV) ..etc.

**Assistant**: Discussed perovskite selection strategy:
- Range of bandgaps (1.0 - 2.3 eV)
- Systematic trends
- Different screening properties
- Publication strategy

**User**: Ah, but what about phonon-assisted auger recombination?

**Assistant**: Discussed complications of phonon-assisted processes:
- Energy/momentum conservation
- Matrix element structure
- Temperature dependence
- Suggested two-paper strategy

**User**: Can you put these thoughts about calculating auger recombination matrix elements, and recombination rate, and publication strategy in a different markdown file as well?

**Assistant**: Created comprehensive documentation in `auger_calculation_strategy.md`

**User**: Can you also add the stuff about why exactly one should have frequency dependent W and not just the static W?

**Assistant**: Added detailed section on importance of dynamic screening:
- Limitations of static screening
- Quantitative impact
- Physical picture
- Energy scales

**User**: What exactly is ΔE here?

**Assistant**: Clarified ΔE definition:
- Energy transfer in Auger process
- Relation to bandgap
- Importance for frequency sampling
- Material-specific values

## Reciprocal Space Calculation of Auger Matrix Elements

### 1. Real Space to Reciprocal Space Transformation

The Auger matrix element in real space is given by:
```
M_Auger = ∫dr dr' ψ₁*(r)ψ₂*(r')W(r,r',ΔE)ψ₃(r)ψ₄(r')
```

To transform this to reciprocal space, we:

1. **Express Wavefunctions in Bloch Form**:
   ```
   ψₙₖ(r) = (1/√V) exp(ik·r) uₙₖ(r)
   ```
   where:
   - n is the band index
   - k is the crystal momentum
   - uₙₖ(r) is the periodic part of the Bloch function
   - V is the crystal volume

2. **Express the Screened Interaction**:
   ```
   W(r,r',ΔE) = (1/V) ∑_{G,G'} W(G,G',q,ΔE) exp[iG·r + iG'·r']
   ```
   where:
   - G, G' are reciprocal lattice vectors
   - q = k₄ - k₂ is the momentum transfer
   - W(G,G',q,ΔE) comes directly from WFULL files

3. **Define Transition Densities**:
   ```
   ρ₁₃(G,q) = ∫dr uₙ₁,k₁*(r)uₙ₃,k₃(r)exp(-iG·r)
   ρ₂₄(G',q) = ∫dr' uₙ₂,k₂*(r')uₙ₄,k₄(r')exp(-iG'·r')
   ```

4. **Final Reciprocal Space Expression**:
   ```
   M_Auger = (1/V) ∑_{G,G'} ρ₁₃(G,q)W(G,G',q,ΔE)ρ₂₄(G',-q)
   ```

### 2. VASP Plane Wave Implementation

1. **Wavefunctions in VASP**:
   In VASP, the wavefunctions are expanded in a plane wave basis:
   ```
   ψₙₖ(r) = (1/√Ω) ∑_G cₙₖ(G) exp[i(k+G)·r]
   ```
   where:
   - Ω is the unit cell volume
   - cₙₖ(G) are the plane wave coefficients from WAVECAR
   - The sum is over G-vectors with kinetic energy ≤ ENCUT

2. **Transition Density in Plane Waves**:
   The transition density ρ₁₃(G,q) becomes:
   ```
   ρ₁₃(G,q) = (1/√Ω) ∑_{G'} c*₁,k₁(G')c₃,k₃(G'+G)
   ```
   where:
   - G' runs over the common G-vectors of states 1 and 3
   - Momentum conservation requires: k₃ = k₁ - q
   - Similar expression for ρ₂₄(G',q)

3. **Matrix Element in Plane Waves**:
   The Auger matrix element becomes:
   ```
   M_Auger = (1/Ω) ∑_{G,G'} [∑_{G₁} c*₁,k₁(G₁)c₃,k₃(G₁+G)] × 
                            W(G,G',q,ΔE) × 
                            [∑_{G₂} c*₂,k₂(G₂)c₄,k₄(G₂+G')]
   ```

### 3. Important Implementation Considerations

1. **G-vector Management**:
   - Energy cutoff determines the G-vector set size
   - Proper handling of G-vector grids between WAVECAR and WFULL
   - Momentum conservation in G-vector selection

2. **Symmetry Utilization**:
   - VASP wavefunctions already include symmetry operations
   - Time-reversal symmetry can reduce computation
   - Point group operations for equivalent transitions

3. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Sparse storage for large G-vector sets
   - Memory-efficient WAVECAR reading
   - Block operations for matrix elements
   - Parallel computation strategies

4. **Convergence Parameters**:
   - ENCUT for wavefunctions
   - Response function cutoff
   - k-point sampling
   - Number of bands

### 4. Physical Validation

1. **Conservation Laws**:
   - Energy conservation: E₃ + E₄ = E₁ + E₂
   - Crystal momentum conservation: k₃ + k₄ = k₁ + k₂ + G
   - Time-reversal symmetry relations

2. **Known Limits**:
   - Long wavelength limit of W(q→0)
   - High-frequency limit of W(ω→∞)
   - Hermiticity of W(G,G',q,ω)

3. **Sum Rules**:
   - f-sum rule for transition rates
   - Spectral weight conservation
   - Detailed balance relations
