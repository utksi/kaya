# Conversation History: Frequency-Dependent Screening and Auger Calculations

## Technical Background

### Key Equations
1. **Screened Coulomb Interaction**
   ```
   W(r,r',ω) = ∫ dr'' ε⁻¹(r,r'',ω) v(r'',r')
   W(G,G',ω) = ε⁻¹(G,G',ω) v(G-G')
   ```

2. **Auger Matrix Element**
   ```
   M_Auger = ∫∫ dr dr' ψ₁*(r)ψ₂*(r')W(r,r',ΔE)ψ₃(r)ψ₄(r')
   ```

3. **Auger Rate**
   ```
   R_Auger = 2π/ℏ ∑_{k1,k2,k3,k4} |M_Auger|² δ(E₁+E₂-E₃-E₄)
   ```

## Initial Discussion: WFULL Files and GW Calculations

**User**: So are these values W(G, G', ω -> 0)?
Can I use these for the matrix elements for auger recombination ..etc?
What do I lose if I don't include frequency?

**Assistant**: Analysis of using W for Auger calculations:

1. Static vs Dynamic W:
   - WFULL files contain W(G,G',q,ω) at specific ω points
   - Static limit (ω→0) overestimates screening
   - Dynamic effects important for Auger processes

2. Impact on Matrix Elements:
   - Auger processes involve energy transfer
   - Matrix element: M_Auger ~ <12|W(ω=ΔE)|34>
   - Using static W(ω=0) misses:
     * Dynamic screening effects
     * Plasmon-assisted processes
     * Energy-dependent screening
     * Retardation effects

3. Error Estimates:
   - Semiconductors: 20-50% error
   - Metals: Larger error due to plasmons
   - Error depends on system and process

**User**: Is there some other alternative to getting frequency dependent W apart from running it again and again to get it at different frequency points?

**Assistant**: Explained several alternatives:
1. Plasmon-Pole Models (PPM)
2. Analytical Continuation
3. Model Dielectric Functions
4. Kramers-Kronig Relations
5. RPA with Model Hamiltonian

**User**: This is what's mentioned about low-scaling GW on the vasp-wiki: [Quoted VASP Wiki content about G0W0R]

**Assistant**: Analyzed G0W0R approach:
- Works on imaginary frequency axis (iω)
- More efficient (cubic scaling)
- Uses ~12-20 frequency points
- Can get full frequency dependence
- Better numerical stability

**User**: Can changes in the existing VASP source code be made to do this?

**Assistant**: Discussed possible modifications to VASP source code to output W(G,G',iω).
Explained key files and implementation strategy.

**User**: How would we get it on the real frequency grid then?

**Assistant**: Clarified difference between:
1. Current WFULL (direct real-axis calculation)
2. G0W0R (imaginary axis + analytical continuation)
Explained advantages of G0W0R approach.

**User**: I was mainly going to go with perovskites like CsPbI3 (gap = 1.7 eV), CsSnI3 (gap = 1.3 eV) ..etc.

**Assistant**: Discussed perovskite selection strategy:
- Range of bandgaps (1.0 - 2.3 eV)
- Systematic trends
- Different screening properties
- Publication strategy

**User**: Ah, but what about phonon-assisted auger recombination?

**Assistant**: Discussed complications of phonon-assisted processes:
- Energy/momentum conservation
- Matrix element structure
- Temperature dependence
- Suggested two-paper strategy

**User**: Can you put these thoughts about calculating auger recombination matrix elements, and recombination rate, and publication strategy in a different markdown file as well?

**Assistant**: Created comprehensive documentation in `auger_calculation_strategy.md`

**User**: Can you also add the stuff about why exactly one should have frequency dependent W and not just the static W?

**Assistant**: Added detailed section on importance of dynamic screening:
- Limitations of static screening
- Quantitative impact
- Physical picture
- Energy scales

**User**: What exactly is ΔE here?

**Assistant**: Clarified ΔE definition:
- Energy transfer in Auger process
- Relation to bandgap
- Importance for frequency sampling
- Material-specific values

        q: Momentum transfer
        dE: Energy transfer
    
    Returns:
        Complex matrix element
    """
    # Get W at needed frequency
    W_dE = interpolate_W(read_wfull_data(), dE)
    
    # Calculate overlap
    return compute_overlap(w1, w2, w3, w4, W_dE)
